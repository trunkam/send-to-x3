## What is this?

**Send to X4** is a small, offline-first utility that helps you move reading-focused content from the web to your Xteink X4 with minimal friction.

It is designed for people who:
- prefer reading on e-ink
- want distraction-free, offline reading
- don't want accounts, sync services, or cloud storage

  ## Usage
  
  ### Sending an Article
  
  1. **Load the article**  
     Open a long-form article, reading-focused page, or Twitter thread while connected to the internet.
  
  2. **Connect to X4**  
     Switch your computer's WiFi to the Xteink X4 hotspot.
  
  3. **Open the extension**  
     Click the **Send to X4** icon in the Chrome toolbar.
  
  4. **Send**  
     Click **Send to X4** to upload the EPUB, or **Download** to save it locally.
  
  ### Managing Device Files
  
  The extension now provides a full file manager for your X4:
  - **View All Files**: Scrollable list of content on the device.
  - **Sort**: Organize by **Date (Newest/Oldest)** or **Name (A-Z)**.
  - **Delete**: Remove old files to free up space.

  ## Twitter/X Support
  
  Send to X4 has specialized logic for X.com:
  - **Smart Thread Extractor**: Automatically detects threads and stitches together tweets from the *original author only*, filtering out noise.
  - **Twitter Articles**: Full support for "Long Posts" / Notes.
  - **Clean Output**: Formatted specifically for e-ink readability.

  ## Workflow (Important)
  
  Send to X4 works best as a simple two-step ritual:
  
  1. ✅ Load the article while connected to the internet  
  2. ✅ Switch to the X4 WiFi hotspot  
  3. ✅ Open the popup and send  
  4. ❌ Do not refresh the page while connected to the X4 hotspot

### Transfer Queue

Use **Queue** while browsing on normal internet WiFi. The extension stores a local article snapshot, so it does not need to re-fetch the source after you connect to the X4 hotspot. You can also add existing EPUB, TXT, and XTC files with **Add files**; imported files are transferred unchanged.

When ready, join the X4 WiFi and click **Send all**. Keep the popup open during a batch transfer. Failed items remain in the local queue and can be retried; queued uploads never fall back to a browser download.

Enable **Organize new uploads by date** in Settings to place new files in `send-to-x4/YYYY-MM-DD/`. It is off by default and existing flat files remain untouched.

  ## Troubleshooting
  
  ### "No article detected"
  - The page must contain enough long-form text
  - Try waiting a few seconds for dynamic pages to load
  - Some highly dynamic sites may not extract well
  
  ### "Not connected to X4"
  - Make sure you are connected to the X4 WiFi hotspot
  - Check your **Settings** block in the popup to ensure the **IP Address** matches your device or firmware type.
  - Open the device IP (e.g., `http://192.168.4.1/`) in your browser to verify connectivity.
  
  ### "Extension context invalidated"
  - Reload the extension from `chrome://extensions/`
  - Reload the article page while on internet WiFi
  - Switch back to the X4 hotspot and try again

  ## Known Limitations
  
  - Text-only (images are temporarily disabled)
  - Requires manual WiFi switching
  - Works best on long-form, reading-oriented pages
